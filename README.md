# tkinter_typing_test
A simple application made using Tkinter for Typing Speed Test

Firstly used Beautiful Soup for scraping 1000 words from this [Site](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-1000-words/).

Made a simple tkinter window having a timer, textbox and entry widget.

Some features:
- Current Word is highlighted in with green background
- After hitting `space` the word is removed from the entry and matched against the active word.
- If the word entered is correct, then the green background is removed and the text color changes to blue
- If the word entered is wrong, then the green background is removed and the text color changes to red
